# Playbook template

Purpose: step-by-step rescue and experimentation playbook for a project.

## Pre-flight
- Identify device MACs and last-known IPs
- Prepare USB-C ethernet adapter and rescue laptop

## Rescue steps
1. Connect laptop via USB-ethernet and run `scripts/rescue_dhcp.sh` (if needed)
2. Attempt to SSH to last-known IP or mDNS name
3. If unreachable, power-cycle device and watch for DHCP/ARP
4. Collect diagnostics with `scripts/collect_diagnostics.sh`
5. If boot ordering is incorrect, run `scripts/fix_boot_order.sh` (requires sudo)

## Post-rescue
- Record the rescue event in `data/records.db` using `scripts/add_record.py`
- Run `scripts/generate_dashboard.py` to refresh dashboard
